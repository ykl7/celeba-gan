# Image Generation by GANs

### Dataset - [Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

### Paper implementation of [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)

Model trained upto 6 iterations of the first epoch as opposed to the planned 25 epochs. It can be found in the ```checkpoint``` directory. Always faced a ```Job terminated due to 32 second jobstep timeout``` kind of error.

Presently, test phase not run (run only on local system) due to abovementioned reason. Will do and post as soon as resources are available again.
